## Project Description and Overview

This project is a comprehensive RESTful API for an online marketplace platform. It enables users to buy and sell products, manage inventory, and process orders efficiently.

Key aspects of the marketplace include:

- **User roles:**
  - **Admin/Seller:** Manages the entire application, including user accounts, products, orders, and categories. They are also responsible for selling products.
  - **Buyer:** Can browse products, place orders, and leave reviews.
- **Product management:** Allows for creation, updating, and deletion of products, with the ability to categorize them for easy browsing.
- **Order processing:** Supports order placement, tracking, and status updates.
- **Review system:** Enables buyers to rate and review products they've purchased and have completed status.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements secure user registration, login, and role-based access control.

## Features

- **Build Tool:** npm (Node Package Manager)

## System Design

### Overview
The system uses an approach of containerizing to manage different aspects of the application. The architecture is divided into three main parts of containers:

- **Parent Container**: This container houses the other two containers. It manages and organizes everything, ensuring all other containers work smoothly together.
- **Application Container**: This container contains the business logic, including all the code and tools needed to process requests, perform business logic, and handle user requests.
- **Database Container**: Houses the database system, managing data storage where, in our case, itâ€™s PostgreSQL.

### Request Process Flow
1. **User Request**: The process begins with a user sending a request.
2. **API Gateway**: The request goes through the API Gateway, which determines the appropriate controller to handle the request (e.g., product controller, review controller).
3. **Middleware**: The request then passes through middleware, where factors like authentication and authorization are checked. This ensures that some resources are accessible to certain users and others are not.
4. **Controller**: After passing through middleware, the request is sent to the relevant controller, which processes the business logic, such as updating product details.
5. **External Services**: If the controller needs to interact with an external service (e.g., sending an email), it communicates with that external service as part of its processing.
6. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**: If the controller needs to interact with the database, it communicates with the DAL using Sequelize. The DAL acts as a bridge between the business logic and the database.
7. **Database Interaction**: The DAL performs the necessary operations on the database.
8. **Response Formation**: Once database operations are complete, the DAL returns data to the controller, which forms a response and sends it back to the user.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to run this application: the standard method and using Docker.

### Environment Setup

1. Rename the .env.example file to .env.
2. Edit the .env file:
   - For standard method: Set HOST=localhost.
   - For Docker method: Set HOST=db.

### Option 1: Standard Method

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL 16

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kent250/awesomity-challenge.git
    cd awesomity-challenge
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up PostgreSQL:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL 16 is installed and running.
   - Create a new server and database for the project.
   - Edit the .env file to match your PostgreSQL credentials:

    ```env
    HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_postgres_username
    DB_PORT=5432
    PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
    ```

4. Start the application:

    ```sh
    nodemon app.js
    # or
    node app.js
    ```

5. The API will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Note: The application uses Sequelize ORM, which will automatically create the necessary database tables on startup.

### Option 2: Using Docker

This is a multi-container application using PostgreSQL 16.3 and Node.js 21-alpine.

1. Navigate to the parent directory containing the .env and docker-compose.yml files.
2. Set up the .env file as described in the Environment Setup section.
3. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

This command will:
- Download the PostgreSQL 16.3 image
- Pull the custom Node.js image from Docker Hub
- Set up and run the containers

4. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Troubleshooting

If only the database container starts, you can try the following:

a. Restart all services:

    ```sh
    docker-compose restart
    ```

b. If the above doesn't work, stop all containers and start again:

    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up
    ```

c. To see logs and identify any issues:

    ```sh
    docker-compose logs
    ```

d. If problems persist, you can try rebuilding the containers:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

These commands should help ensure both the database and application containers start properly.
